# ChatGenius App

Chat apps, such as Slack, are a foundational element of the modern workplace. If you work remotely, they are the workplace - and even if you work in-person, chat apps enable asynchronous collaboration and integration with other common tools.

But chat apps arenâ€™t perfect - written text lacks the nuance of the voice and facial expressions. Chatting can be less engaging, or even less accurate, with people missing key pieces of information.
ChatGenius tackles this by applying generative AI, not to replace humans but to augment them. It gives the user a professional digital twin, an AI avatar that can represent them but still have a personal touch.
